# Krypton Cryptography Suite
Krypton is a modular and extensible library suite for cryptography in Kotlin/Multiplatform with support for Linux, Windows, macOS, Android and iOS based on more-tested libraries in the backend like OpenSSL or the JCA. Below this text you can see a list of the modules of Krypton:
- **krypton-core:** Core components of the Krypton library (Algorithm interface etc.)
- **krypton-asn1:** Cross-platform ASN.1 binary format parser with support for [`kotlinx.serialization`](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.serialization)
- **krypton-keystore:** Implementation of Native keystores with support for parsing Java Keystores on different platforms
- **krypton-openssl:** Windows, Linux, macOS and iOS bindings for [OpenSSL](https://github.com/openssl/openssl) [(Apache License 2.0)](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/master/LICENSE.txt)

The default implementation of Krypton supports different algorithms. Below this text you can see a list of the by-default implemented algorithms:
- **Cryptographic hash functions:** SHA3 (224, 256, 384 and 512 bits), SHA (224, 256, 384 and 512 bits) and MD5
- **Symmetric encryption algorithms:** AES, DES and Triple-DES
- **Asymmetric encryption algorithms:** RSA
- **Key Agreements:** Diffie-Hellman (DH) and Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH)
- **Signature algorithms:** RSA and ECDSA

## Credits
Some parts of this project are based on the work of other great people. In this part of the README I want to thank them and show a list of my inspirations etc.
- [trixnity-openssl-binaries](https://gitlab.com/trixnity/trixnity-openssl-binaries) - The OpenSSL binaries are acquired by the publications of this repository
- [trixnity-crypto-core](https://gitlab.com/trixnity/trixnity/-/tree/main/trixnity-crypto-core?ref_type=heads) - The integration of OpenSSL over multiple targets is heavily inspired that builscript code
- [A Layman's Guide to a Subset of ASN.1, BER, and DER](https://luca.ntop.org/Teaching/Appunti/asn1.html) - Used for the implementation of the ASN.1 parser
